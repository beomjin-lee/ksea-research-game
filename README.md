## Introduction
This project is Made by KSEA Project Research and SW Team 2018 at UC Berkeley.

We have built games for Tic-Tac-Toe and Tetris, both of which can be found in their respective directories. In addition, we built AIs for the games, one utilizing classic Mini/Expecti-Max algorithm and the other using genetic algorithm.
